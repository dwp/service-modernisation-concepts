        Account home page
      </h1>

      <p>This page explains research and design specific to the <a href="home">Account home page</a>. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      What was the design intention?
      </h2>
      <p>We wanted to concept test the features and functionality of the application tracking, checking payments and providing an update (change of circumstances) parts of the end-to-end journey from the <a href="https://dwpdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/S2/pages/133809799850/Phase+2+Service+Blueprint" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">future state service blueprint</a> (opens in new tab). They needed a context for us to explore them so we wireframed what a customer might see once they've logged in. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Did we test it?</h2>
      <p>This page was tested with around 18 users in round 2 and round 3 of research. </p>

     <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Design changes from the tested version visible in this prototype</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Minor changes in font size to make the content hierarchy clearer. </li>
        <li>Minor changes to bring content into line with the GDS style guide (e.g. capitalisation). </li>
        <li>Top horizontal navigation header uses the new GDS Design System grey <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/service-navigation/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">service navigation component</a> (opens in new tab), which is a new component published in summer 2024, after the research took place instead of the header used in the Mural designs, which is not part of the Design System.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Detailed research summary</h2>
      <p>Participants found the page straightforward and concise in terms of both content and design. </p>
     
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>This new version was preferred by some users familiar with the current application process.
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li> One participant liked that the page felt personalised because of the name that was displayed. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The 'Your Application' section was the most frequently mentioned section and generally well-liked. 
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Participants appreciated its ability to show where they were in the application process (timeline displayed). 
              </li>
              <li>Pain points: 
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>Some users didn’t understand whether the widget would refer to one or multiple benefits. </li>
                <li>One person thought the application status would appear at the top of the page. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
        </li>
        <li>The 'Upcoming Payments' section was mentioned frequently as well.
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>This section helped some participants understand what payments to expect and to be able 'to budget'. </li>
            <li>Participants usually use the 'View your benefit payments' link or the menu bar to check payments. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>General pain points:
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Confusion about why payments take 7 days to appear. </li>
            <li>Font design concerns (<a href="https://app.mural.co/t/dwpdigital7412/m/dwpdigital7412/1732879888453/587ecb81b29750051dc07d827da2f9e01c7b63d2?wid=0-1732881038163" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">see 'Account and Home Screen' area of Mural board of consolidated analysis</a>, opens in new tab). </li>
            <li>Missing option to apply for other benefits. </li>
            <li>Missing log in/log out option. </li>

          </ul>
        </li>
       </ul>
      
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Considerations for further research and design work</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Explore how we can allow a user to track multiple applications and how we can create a consistent experience across pages and benefits. Consider user needs for wanting to see where they are in the application process.  </li>
        <li>Ensure any design for progress tracking meets design guidelines. </li>
        <li>Understand what communication users currently receive in relation to their benefit payments (letters, text messages, emails and so on). </li>
        <li>Review the pain points and address them when designing similar pages.  </li>
       </ul>
